About the role
The Customer Ops Strategy Associate role is a generalist role at Clipboard suited for the “all-around athlete” type who can do it all and wants exposure to a range of problems and opportunities. 
You’re likely someone who’s interested in and capable of solving different problem types – you’re resourceful, adaptable, and confident you can figure it out if you can sink your teeth in deep enough. These are the ingredients for a problem-solver who is eager to flex into multiple different types of roles and responsibilities depending on what’s needed and most impactful.
While we know which team you’ll join as part of your first “tour of duty” (see below), we don’t know exactly what work or projects you’ll drive out of the gate, so you’ll notice the work we’re advertising isn’t entirely specific. It depends on your strengths and what we learn during both the recruiting process and your first days at Clipboard. But we’ll make a few promises to you about the role: it’ll be high-impact, fast-paced work that has an impact on our customers and on our business.
In terms of “what might I actually do” – here’s a list of example initiatives to give you an idea:
Redesign our process for reaching out to workplaces about converting them to new methods of payment, such as getting customers who send checks to start paying us via eCheck to speed up the cash conversion process
Research, vet, and onboard a new vendor that embeds AI agents into our customer-facing collections efforts
Build an internal predictive analytics model to catch bad payers earlier with high accuracy
Manage a team of Collections Account Managers 
  First tour of duty
Our most immediate need right now in Customer Operations is in the Billing team. You can read a quick background of what the Billing team does below, but the TLDR is that we want to collect money as fast as possible and minimize losses, while preserving the customer experience, in service of reliably converting revenue into cash (the lifeline of a capital-intensive business like ours). This in a way is “ensuring high-quality growth” for the company. 
With thousands of customers operating in different regulatory environments, under different conditions, with nuanced capital structures and corporate setups, and using varied complicated processes – this can be hard to do at scale. Your first tour of duty would be on the Billing team, where you’ll help us strengthen the quality of our team with things like increasing the speed at which we collect money and better vetting our customer base at scale to be confident in their financial position, all while improving the customer experience through things like lightning-fast response times. 
Oh, and by the way, you don’t need to be an expert in finance or accounting – while it’d be a plus, we expect you to learn the basics along the way. 
  Quick background on Billing
There’s much to explain to paint the full picture of the Billing machine, but ultimately the core goal is to optimize the speed with which our customers pay us while maintaining their overall experience with us as a vendor. 
Although Clipboard provides a service where workplaces can find qualified professionals to fill shifts, we are in many ways a lending company at our core since we pay professionals immediately after they work a shift. For illustrative purposes: a nurse works a shift → we pay the nurse $100 immediately with our cash → the workplace pays us $120 a month later. We extend debt to workplaces using cash we borrow, with interest, from an Asset-Backed Line (ABL) of credit – workplaces use that debt to pay their staffing costs, and we expect to be paid back by the workplaces at a later date based on agreed-upon net terms. 
The point is: Billing is doing the critical work of actually converting our revenue into cash that we put in the bank. Otherwise, money we cannot collect is money we’ve burned. We consistently fight a multi-faceted battle: a battle wherein we must maximize the speed at which we recognize revenue, maximize the margin associated with each shift, and maximize the customer experience, all without letting one unduly impact the other. Optimizing collections is critical to make sure Clipboard is generating sustainable, high-quality growth and turning top-line revenue into cash that we use to service or grow other parts of the business. 
  Who we're looking for
We find those who are most successful in this type of role:
Are insatiably curious and notice non-obvious clues and patterns: Curiosity sits atop our company values. Understanding something from first principles and getting to the root cause of the problem will often reveal the best solution, and a natural and unwavering curiosity to keep asking questions and digging will take you most of the way.
Roll up their sleeves and go to the source: There are multiple ways to say this: touching reality, dogfooding, seeing for yourself, going to the front-lines, etc. Don’t just take someone’s word for it – go find out yourself by testing the feature, or listening to the agent call, or calling the customer, or executing the workflow. This is how you seek truth.
Bring a tenacity and persistence to problem-solving: You’ll hit walls and find yourself in uncertain and unfamiliar situations. If you can sit with the uncertainty, look at the problem from new angles, and keep applying pressure to a problem – you’ll position yourself for breakthroughs.
Bounce back from failure quickly: You’ll make mistakes, move in the wrong direction, and stumble from time-to-time. Just avoid big mistakes and don’t make the same mistakes twice, and learn from them quickly. Worry less about failing and more about losing momentum in your feedback loop. If you fail cheaply and quickly, that's worth the lesson/learning you get in return. 
We are hiring multiple people and are hiring indefinitely for this role. We won’t close the funnel prematurely based on other candidates. We will hire everyone that meets our threshold of excellence, and hope you meet our criteria.
We do not require any experience for this role. Experience will be taken into consideration for both (a) the work you’re placed into once hired and (b) compensation. In addition to experience, these two items are determined by performance during the interview process.
  Why Join Clipboard?
100% Remote – Always. Work from anywhere in the world.
Fast-Paced Startup Environment. Join a company that values curiosity, independence, and growth.
A Hiring Process That Rewards Skills, Not Just Experience. Every applicant gets a fair shot—our selection is based on real-world problem-solving ability, not just credentials.

About the Role
We’re looking for a Forward Deployed Data Scientist to partner closely with our AI Decisioning customers and internal engineering teams to ensure that AI-driven marketing campaigns deliver measurable, compounding impact. This role is uniquely cross-functional: you’ll spend time diagnosing model behavior, tuning ML levers, analyzing incrementality, exploring customer data, and explaining insights to marketers and executives.
Marketing teams come to Hightouch to transform how they operate. Instead of planning campaigns weeks ahead on a calendar, AI Decisioning continuously learns customer preferences and executes 1:1 messaging that adapts in real time. Your mission is to make sure that these AI agents perform at their best—and to help customers understand why they are performing the way they are.
You’ll work alongside ML engineers, product managers, Solutions Consultants, and some of the world’s most recognizable brands to improve campaign performance, debug experiments, and identify opportunities for additional lift. Roughly 30% of your time will be customer-facing and 70% deep analytical and modeling work.
No two days are the same, but you can expect to:
Own diagnostics, insights, and tuning for AI Decisioning campaigns
Explain why AI Decisioning is driving lift using counterfactuals, incrementality breakdowns, and cohort analysis.
Debug performance issues, iterate on reward functions, and ensure the agent’s recommendations align with customer goals.

Work deeply with data in notebooks and customer warehouses
Pull down historical data to run exploratory analyses using Polars / Pandas in Jupyter notebooks
Modify and improve customer feature matrices to unlock deep personalization.
Conduct deeper warehouse-level SQL analyses when insights aren’t available in the UI.
Build lightweight tooling that enables scale
Create templates, notebooks, scripts, and repeatable workflows that improve how we analyze performance across customers.
Identify systemic gaps and influence the direction of ML reporting and introspection.
Communicate ML concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders
Present model insights and recommendations to marketers, analysts, and executives.
Explain how the decision engine handles cold start, message transfer learning, exploration vs. exploitation, and more.
Partner closely with Solutions Consultants to identify and drive new opportunities for uplift.
What We’re Looking For
Strong ability to perform deep exploratory data analysis in Python (Polars / Pandas, Jupyter notebooks).
Ability to write and interpret SQL for customer warehouse analysis.
High-level understanding of ML modeling concepts (features, hyperparameters, reward functions, training windows).
Excellent communication skills; able to explain technical reasoning simply and confidently to marketers.
A customer-first attitude with high ownership and urgency when resolving issues.
Bonus Points
Experience setting up and analyzing marketing experiments such as A/B, multivariate tests.
Prior experience in an applied ML, data science, analytics engineering, or forward-deployed role.
Experience building lightweight internal tools or scripting solutions.
We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals who are interested in tackling the problems above. We focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The salary range for this position is $140,000 - $220,000 USD per year, which is location independent in accordance with our remote-first policy.
Interview Process
Our interview process evaluates the most important dimensions of the role: analytical depth, customer communication, first-principles problem solving, and alignment with Hightouch’s values.
Intro Call [15–30m]
Introductory call with either a member of our recruiting team or the hiring manager to get to know each other and see if the role could be a good mutual fit.
Take Home Data Analysis Exercise + Review Session [45m]
You’ll complete a short take-home assignment focused on exploratory data analysis of an example dataset. In the live review, you’ll walk through your approach, explain your reasoning, and present your findings as if you were guiding a customer through your analysis. We’re looking for clarity of communication, rigor of thinking, and the ability to turn data into actionable insights.
Experiment Design & Analysis Session [90m]
A hands-on session where we collaboratively design and evaluate an experiment end-to-end. This includes:
Defining the experimental goal and how success should be measured
Identifying the most relevant context and features to use in modeling
Interpreting example results and diagnosing performance patterns
Recommending next steps and communicating tradeoffs
Hiring Manager Interview [30m]
Chat with hiring manager about past experiences and future operating preferences to assess fit on company values and operating principles.

Data Scientist
About the company: 
The mining industry has steadily become worse at finding new ore deposits, requiring >10X more capital to make discoveries compared to 30 years ago. The easy-to-find, near-surface deposits have largely been found, and the industry has chronically under-invested in new exploration technology, relying on the manual techniques of yesteryear – even as demand accelerates for copper, lithium, and other metals to build electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.
KoBold builds AI models for mineral exploration and deploys those models—alongside our novel sensors—to guide decisions on KoBold-owned-and-operated exploration programs. In the six years since founding, KoBold has become by far both the largest independent mineral exploration company and the largest exploration technology developer. Our data scientists and software engineers, who come from leading technology companies, jointly lead exploration programs with our renowned exploration geologists.
KoBold has proven its first discovery with materially less capital than the industry average and found one of the best copper deposits ever discovered: the copper is far more concentrated than the global average of copper mines, and this asset alone is expected to generate meaningful revenue for decades. KoBold has a portfolio of more than 60 other projects, each of which has the potential for another high-quality discovery.
KoBold is privately held; investors include institutional asset managers T. Rowe Price and Canada Pension Plan Investments; technology venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BOND Capital, and Standard Investments; and natural resources companies Equinor, BHP, and Mitsubishi.
We are hiring a Data Scientist to help accelerate our mission.
About the position
In this role, you will build predictive models and apply a wide range of scientific computing, statistical, and physics-based methods to find places where there is evidence of ore-forming processes at work and to predict the locations of ore-grade mineralization in 2D and 3D. You will help build a worldwide dataset that underlies our exploration program, with careful attention to identifying and quantifying uncertainty in the data and in our predictions. You will create models and develop software to accelerate discovery of critical battery metals.
You will join an outstanding team of data scientists and engineers and will work closely with KoBold’s world-renowned geoscientists to incorporate our best understanding of the chemical and physical processes that create ore deposits. Working with your geoscience colleagues, you will create 2D and 3D geologic predictions, identify exploration targets, design field programs to collect data, and use that data to reduce the uncertainty in our predictions and guide the next phase of field work.
Ultimately, your role is to help KoBold make valuable discoveries by building data tools to solve scientific problems. As one of the early members of this team, you will help build these tools from the ground up.
Responsibilities
The Data Scientist will:
Help develop KoBold’s proprietary software exploration tools.
Find and curate  geophysical, geochemical, geologic, and geographic data and integrate it into KoBold’s proprietary data system.

Exceptional curiosity and eagerness to learn, with a proactive approach to exploring new concepts and technologies.
Excitement about joining a fast-growing early-stage company, comfort with a dynamic work environment, and eagerness to take on a range of responsibilities.
Ability to independently prioritize multiple tasks effectively.
It is also helpful but not required to have experience with:
Creating machine learning models on geospatial data
Geostatistics
Image processing or computer vision
Distributed computing applications for machine learning and other computations

Personalization and Product Recommendation: There are often many options for what content a company could message a user with, including which products to show from catalogues. Given this large state space, how can Hightouch help personalize messages with the most relevant content for each user?
Automated Experimentation: Helping companies intelligently navigate and automate experiments across the extensive number of options for messaging customers.
Predictive Audiences: Building models to predict which users are most likely to convert, churn, or take desired actions.
Content Generation: Particularly with recent advances in LLMs, how can we help marketers generate text, images, and creatives that are compelling to their customers?
Budget Optimization: Helping companies assess which marketing spend is driving the most incremental conversions, and where the marginal CAC is lowest.
As an early machine learning engineer, you will help build comprehensive solutions to the above domains from scratch. Responsibilities will be highly varied and include working on customer research, problem definition, predictive modeling, machine learning infrastructure, and partnering with customers.
We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals who are interested in tackling the problems above. This is a senior role, but we focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The salary range for this position is $200,000 - $260,000 USD per year, which is location independent in accordance with our remote-first policy.
Interview Process
Our interview process focuses on evaluating fit for the most important dimensions of the role: product sense, ability to architect backend and distributed systems, and alignment with Hightouch’s values. Notably, we don’t do any programming interviews as we believe they are low signal to noise and aren’t a good evaluation mechanism.
Intro Call [15-30m]: Introductory call with either a member of our recruiting team or the hiring manager to get to know each other and see if the role could be a good mutual fit.
System Design Screen [45m]: Designing a data processing feature end-to-end.
Machine Learning Modeling Interview [90m]: Designing a predictive model end-to-end, including data collection and preparation, model training and evaluation, and what systems would be needed to run the model in production.
System Design Interview [90m]: Work with the interviewer to architect a system at a conceptual level. The problem will be at a pretty high level - and have both product and customer requirements as well as technical.
Hiring Manager Interview [30m]: Chat with hiring manager about past experiences and future operating preferences to assess fit on company values and operating principles.

In the 1840s, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace worked on an early version of the computer known as the “Analytics Engine.” In the words of computing historian Doron Swade, “What Lovelace saw…was that numbers could represent entities other than quantity” and together they laid the foundation for general-purpose computing.
While much has changed since then, the importance of numbers in building great technology remains. We’re looking for a Data Scientist who can help us build our analytics engine by making meaning from data and identifying opportunities for improvement.
As a Data Scientist at Mercury focused on Financial & Accounting Workflows, you will partner with product and engineering teams building tools that help founders, bookkeepers, and finance teams manage their businesses. Your work will span core accounting needs (Books, Accounting Integrations) and broader financial workflows (spend management, invoicing, payroll, etc.). You’ll develop deep expertise in how these workflows can be automated, streamlined, and made more insightful through data. Your impact will shape how customers adopt, engage with, and find value in Mercury’s financial tools.
Here are some things you’ll do on the job:
Partner with Financial & Accounting Workflow stakeholders (Books, Accounting Integrations, Spend Management, Payroll) to define success metrics for new product initiatives and ensure teams have the right measurements in place.
Collaborate with product and engineering to design and analyze experiments that guide product decisions and validate impact.
Contribute to launches of new products like Books by helping scope success criteria, tracking adoption, and analyzing performance post-launch.
Work closely with product teams to surface insights that inform iteration and help identify opportunities for deeper engagement or new product lines.
Partner with engineers to prototype and apply ML/AI solutions (such as autocategorization, reconciliation, or intelligent recommendations)  that streamline financial workflows.
Build dashboards, data pipelines, and reporting that enable self-serve analytics for product and business partners.
You should:
Have 3–5 years of experience in product analytics or data science, ideally with exposure to financial workflows, accounting, or B2B SaaS products.
Be fluent in SQL and proficient in a statistical programming language (e.g., Python).
Have experience designing and analyzing A/B tests, and applying causal inference methods.
Be comfortable building data pipelines, dashboards, and reports using modern data stack tools such as Snowflake, dbt, and Omni or Metabase.
Have experience with ERP/accounting systems (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite) or accounting workflows.
Experience applying ML or GenAI to real-world product problems.
Be organized and communicative, able to manage multiple priorities and collaborate with stakeholders at different levels of technical fluency.
The total rewards package at Mercury includes base salary, equity (stock options), and benefits. Our salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry. New hire offers are made based on a candidate’s experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.

Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with over 300 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
The Opportunity
At Netflix, innovation in foundation models is redefining how we understand stories and personalize experiences for hundreds of millions of members worldwide. The Content Representation Models (CRM) team sits at the center of this transformation, creating unified representations of content that power personalization and discovery across Netflix.
This team develops the embedding models that understand our catalog at every level, from rich metadata-based representations (e.g., tags, talent, synopsis, IP) to media-based representations learned directly from video, audio, and text. Together, these representations form the backbone of how we represent content in our algorithms. 
As Netflix expands into new content types and formats: from live and interactive experiences to games and podcasts – the need for deeper semantic understanding of our content becomes even more critical. Large vision and language models (VLMs, MLLMs, and GenAI systems) now make it possible to understand media at a far more nuanced and fine-grained level, and this team is bringing those capabilities into the heart of personalization, helping our algorithms reason about stories, style, and audience engagement.
These embeddings are foundational not only to personalization and search, but also to applications across Ads, Content & Studio Data Science, and other business verticals: driving insights, optimization, and creativity at scale.
We are looking for a seasoned engineering leader to guide this world-class team of ML researchers and engineers. You will lead the evolution of Netflix’s content embedding ecosystem — advancing the science of multimodal and metadata-based representation learning, ensuring reliability and adoption in production, and partnering to deliver impact.
Questions Your Team Will Help Answer
The Content Representation Models team provides a unified, semantically rich representation of content, enabling more engaging recommendations and creative insights. Some of the strategic questions the team answers include:
How can we represent every title, episode, and clip, across video, audio, text, and metadata, in a shared embedding space?
How can unified content representations enable personalization and discovery across Netflix products?
How do we measure and improve the semantic and engagement quality of our embeddings?
What foundation architectures (e.g., multimodal LLMs, ensemble embeddings) best capture the richness of Netflix content?
How do we ensure our embedding pipelines are reliable, reproducible, and production-grade?
In This Role, You Will
Lead a team of researchers and engineers advancing both media-based and metadata-based representations of content.
Drive innovation in foundation model research, leveraging large language and vision-language models to enhance metadata and media understanding, and using Netflix’s unique long-form media and engagement data to create richer, more personalized representations.
Ensure production excellence across embedding pipelines – maintaining reliability, performance, and scalability.
Guide adoption of embeddings as first-class products, partnering with downstream application teams to maximize business and product impact.
Minimum Qualifications
Proven track record of building and leading high-performing ML research or foundation model teams.
Experience developing and/or deploying large-scale representation learning, multimodal, or embedding systems.
Strong technical judgment in foundation model architecture, training, evaluation, and deployment.
Experience balancing research exploration with production reliability.
Strong collaboration and communication skills – able to represent technical work to non-technical partners.
Demonstrated ability to drive cross-functional adoption of platform-level ML capabilities.
Advanced degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related quantitative field, or equivalent practical experience.
Preferred Qualifications
8+ years of experience in ML or AI, including 3+ years leading technical teams.
Background in multimodal learning, contrastive training, or LLM-based embedding architectures.
Experience building ML systems used across multiple product surfaces.
Experience with large-scale distributed training, embedding infrastructure, or evaluation frameworks.
Familiarity with both research-oriented and production-grade ML workflows.

Job Description
Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.
Servus, hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.
Where and how you can work
Our flagship campus is in Sydney, Australia but Austria is home to part of our European operations. And you have choice in where and how you work, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals.
Fun fact, a big part of our Austrian operations is developing the AI product within Canva to help reimagine how artificial intelligence can be used in design. Pretty cool ha!
What you’d be doing in this role
As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.
At the moment, this role is focused on:
Tell the Story Behind the Numbers Craft clear, actionable narratives using data. Turn complex insights into simple stories that inspire action—whether with product teams, regional leadership, or the whole company.
Identify Problems Before They’re Obvious Proactively surface growth bottlenecks, user behavior shifts, or product mismatches in the region—so we’re always one step ahead.
Build the Data Foundation for GPTN Design and build dashboards from scratch that bring visibility to our most important GPTN metrics—across user growth, retention, monetization, campaign performance, and more.
Own GPTN Data Strategy End-to-End Define how we track success across the region by setting clear and relevant targets. Build frameworks and KPIs that help us measure impact and make better decisions—tailored to local market nuance.
Partner with Local, Regional, and Central Teams Act as the bridge between our GPTN teams (marketing, country managers, community), and global product and data functions. Ensure local insights are reflected in global priorities, and ensure a two-way flow of local and global insights.
Support Product & Experimentation Initiatives Work closely with product teams to help design and measure new feature performance, local experiments, and A/B tests in the markets.
You're probably a match if
You have several years of experience in data analytics, growth, or product analytics roles
You have strong SQL and Python data wrangling skills; able to work independently with large, messy datasets
You do have experience partnering with cross-functional teams (marketing, product, growth, ops), and using data to influence decisions
You bring strong communication and storytelling skills—you make data land, not just show up
You are a strategic thinker who can zoom out and prioritize what really moves the needle
You have proven experience building dashboards and tracking frameworks from the ground up
You have the ability to define and track key metrics across the user journey (e.g., signups, MAU, retention, monetization)
You bring a bias to action—you’re comfortable in ambiguity and take ownership without waiting for a brief
You had prior exposure to experimentation and A/B testing frameworks
You have a familiarity with Canva’s data stack (Looker, Snowflake, Mode, Netspring)
Nice-to-Haves
Experience working in or analyzing European markets
Understanding of mobile analytics and behavioral funnels
Experience supporting product teams or market localization initiatives
Passion for Canva’s mission and a natural curiosity for how people use technology across cultures
About the team
At Canva, we’ve just unlocked a huge opportunity in GPTN (Germany, Poland, Turkey, Netherlands): for the first time, we’re building a dedicated regional team to understand, grow, and serve the unique needs of our users across the four countries.
As the Regional Data Lead for GPTN, you’ll be the first dedicated analytics voice for this region—shaping how we understand our users, measure what matters, and build a data-informed growth strategy that connects our local markets with our global product teams.
If you’re excited about building from scratch, partnering closely with teams across marketing, product, and community, and helping one of the world’s fastest-growing platforms localize with care—this is your chance.
What's in it for you?
Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.
Here's a taste of what's on offer:
Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
Check out lifeatcanva.com for more info.
At Canva we value fairness, and we strive to provide competitive, market-informed compensation whilst ensuring internal equity within the team in each region. We make hiring decisions based on your skills, experience and our overall assessment of what we observed and learned in the hiring process. The starting salary for this position is EUR 80,000 gross/year. When calculating offers, we make salary decisions based on market data and candidates' skills and experience.
Other stuff to know
We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.

Pinterest Ads Delivery & Performance is redefining how digital ads are delivered - challenging 20 years of assumptions to both protect the Pinner experience and grow durable revenue. We support all ad surfaces across Pinterest - Home Feed, Search, Related Pins, Shopping surfaces, Idea Streams, and beyond - each with unique marketplace and product dynamics. You’ll lead a high‑impact data science organization that partners deeply with Product, Engineering, Research, and other cross functional partners to build the next generation of advertising products and systems.
About the role We’re looking for a Director who is a leader of leaders and a systems thinker. You will set the strategy for ads delivery and quality, establish the measurement and decision frameworks, and scale a best‑in‑class team of data scientists. A core mandate for this role is to identify, instrument, and operationalize the input metrics that most directly drive ads delivery, quality, and performance - ensuring we are optimizing the levers that move outcomes, not just reporting on lagging KPIs.
What you’ll do:
Set strategy and outcomes
Define the multi‑year vision and roadmap for Ads Delivery & Performance across all Pinterest surfaces, aligning to company and Ads org priorities.
Establish clear north-star outcomes (e.g., long‑term revenue quality, retained advertiser value, Pinner experience) and the right cascade of input metrics and guardrails that drive them.
Make input metrics a first‑class operating system
Identify, define, and instrument the input metrics that most influence delivery and performance, such as: supply health and coverage, eligibility and match rate, win rate, fill rate, pacing and spend smoothness, auction/bid competitiveness, latency/SLA adherence, ranking/model freshness and coverage, feature quality, CTR/CVR leading indicators, frequency and ad load distribution, quality/relevance signals, and policy/trust frictions.
Build metric specs, ownership, alerting, and weekly business reviews so that teams operate to inputs (and understand their elasticities to outcomes like RPM, ROAS, advertiser retention, and Pinner satisfaction).
Lead an organization of leaders
Hire, develop, and inspire a diverse, high‑performance organization of data science managers and senior ICs; set crisp role definitions, growth paths, and succession planning.
Establish rigorous standards for experimentation, causal inference, and production analytics; ensure consistently trustworthy, decision‑grade outputs.
Partner to ship impact
Work hand‑in‑hand with Product and Engineering on marketplace, ranking, pacing, and quality systems (e.g., auction design, supply/demand balancing, relevance, cold‑start, ads load/frequency, shopping ads delivery).
Translate ambiguous business questions into structured analyses and roadmaps; ensure the org moves from insight to shipped change with measurable impact.
Elevate measurement and decision quality
Own the measurement strategy for ads quality and delivery: counterfactual measurement, lift and incrementality, experiment design, long‑term value, and guardrail monitoring for Pinner experience.
Improve our decision frameworks, define minimum statistical standards, and drive consistency in A/B testing, quasi‑experiments, and observational methods when experiments are impractical.
Communicate and align
Present complex analytical findings to executives and cross‑functional partners with clarity; drive alignment on trade‑offs across revenue, advertiser value, and Pinner experience.
Create transparent operating cadences (QBRs/MBRs, input metric reviews, launch reviews) that keep teams focused on the levers that matter.
What we’re looking for:
MS or PhD in a quantitative field (Computer Science, Statistics, Math, Engineering, Economics or related) or equivalent practical experience.
10+ years in Data Science, Algorithmic Engineering, or Machine Learning, with significant impact in digital advertising or large‑scale marketplaces.
5+ years directly managing data science organizations, including managing managers and scaling multi‑team groups in a technology company.
Deep experience with:
Statistical analysis and causal inference, experiment design, and measurement for complex marketplaces.
Production analytics and large‑scale data tooling (e.g., Python/R, SQL; Spark/Hive or similar).
Applied ML or relevance/ranking systems; familiarity with auction dynamics, pacing, bidding, and quality/relevance modeling.
Proven track record of establishing and operating through input metrics tied to business outcomes.
Excellent written and verbal communication; adept at influencing senior cross‑functional partners and executives.
In-Office Requirement Statement:
We let the type of work you do guide the collaboration style. That means we're not always working in an office, but we continue to gather for key moments of collaboration and connection.
This role will need to be in the office for in-person collaboration 1-2 times/quarter and therefore can be situated anywhere in the country.
Relocation Statement:
This position is not eligible for relocation assistance. Visit our PinFlex page to learn more about our working model.

Job Description
Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.
Hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.
Where and how you can work
The buzzing Canva London campus features several buildings around beautiful leafy Hoxton Square in Shoreditch. While our global headquarters is in Sydney, Australia, London is our HQ for Europe, with all kinds of teams based here, plus event spaces to gather our team and communities. You'll experience a warm welcome from our Vibe team at front of house, amazing home cooked food from our Head Chef and a variety of workspaces to hang out with your team mates or get solo work done. That said, we trust our Canvanauts to choose the balance that empowers them and their team to achieve their goals and so you have choice in where and how you work.
What you’d be doing in this role
As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.
At the moment, this role is focused on:
Find insights that help us understand both Affinity and our customers - we want you to be creative and insightful, rather than just throwing the usual metrics at the wall to see what sticks.
Suggest and run interesting experiments that will actually move our metrics - when we push tests to 100% we want to actually see the bump in the relevant graph.
Build and maintain dashboards for our product teams, and make them look really good - you don’t need to be a designer or have any design talent, you just need to want to build cool things!
Own projects, data models, dashboards, and other artefacts and keep them up-to-date and high quality in a hypergrowth environment.
Use our giant databases to answer the sort of questions that sound really simple but turn out to be challenging (and fun!).
Help us extend data literacy and curiosity throughout the whole company.
You're probably a match if
You have strong competency with SQL. Experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
You are experienced with data wrangling and analyzing data using Python or R.
You can demonstrate skills across optimising product funnels, running experiments, and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.
You may have a grounding in mathematics/statistics and a bachelor's degree in a STEM area (not mandatory).
You may have played with very large data sets (not mandatory).
You are a strong communicator, verbally and written, with the ability to break down complex topics into simple solutions and ideas.
About the team
We’re on a mission to empower creatives everywhere with world-class, fast, and intuitive creative software applications. The Affinity team brings together passionate engineers, designers, and product experts to redefine how professionals and enthusiasts approach photo editing, vector design, and layout. Our work enables creators across industries to bring their ideas to life, and every innovation we ship helps them do it faster, smarter, and more beautifully. We're a close-knit team that values performance, precision, rich UI and pushing creative boundaries.
We’re looking for a data scientist who is eager to help Affinity forge ahead into a new product space by helping to shape product decisions through actionable insights, experimentation, and reporting.
You’ll work closely with our product, engineering, community and marketing teams to uncover the right questions to ask and bring strategic thinking to every decision. You’ll be part of a dedicated, cross-functional squad that supports you in doing your best work. Your coach will guide your personal and professional growth so you can focus on what you love and keep getting better at it.
What's in it for you?
Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a range of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.
Here's a taste of what's on offer:
Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
Check out lifeatcanva.com for more info.
Other stuff to know
We make hiring decisions based on your experience, skills and passion, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. When you apply, please tell us the pronouns you use and any reasonable adjustments you may need during the interview process.
We celebrate all types of skills and backgrounds at Canva so even if you don’t feel like your skills quite match what’s listed above - we still want to hear from you!
Please note that interviews are conducted virtually.

We hire great people from diverse backgrounds and experiences because it makes our company stronger. We value diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging as necessary to achieve our mission and impact the communities we serve. We know that transforming education starts in-house with learning about ourselves and our colleagues. We strive to be world-class in investing in our people and commit to developing you as a professional.
THE ROLE
We’re looking for an ML Data Engineer to evolve our eval dataset tools to meet the growing platform needs of AI-based tutoring at Khan Academy. We’re looking for someone who can gather internal requirements, design schema based on well-known dataset patterns, and deploy, document, and train people on an internal dataset management framework. The systems you design will need to integrate with trace management and human labeling APIs. You’ll work closely with other AI engineers, platform developers, and labeling teams to ensure our data is clean, representative, and ready for both human and automated evaluation.
This role bridges ML operations, data engineering and data science— enabling our AI systems to learn from reliable, well-structured datasets that reflect the diversity and nuance of real learners.
As a Platform Engineer focused on dataset management systems, you will:
Evolve and maintain pipelines for transforming raw trace data into ML-ready datasets.
Clean, normalize, and enrich data while preserving semantic meaning and consistency.
Prepare and format datasets for human labeling, and integrate results into ML datasets.
Develop and maintain scalable ETL pipelines using Airflow, DBT, Go, and Python running on GCP
Implement automated tests and validation to detect data drift or labeling inconsistencies.
Collaborate with AI engineers, platform developers, and product teams to define data strategies in support of continuously improving the quality of Khan’s AI-based tutoring.
Contribute to shared tools and documentation for dataset management and AI evaluation.
Inform our data governance strategies for proper data retention, PII controls/scrubbing, and isolation of particularly sensitive data such as offensive test imagery
We are a remote-first organization, and we strive to build using technology that is best suited to solving problems for our learners. Currently, we build with Go, GraphQL, JavaScript, React & React Native, Redux and we adopt new technologies like LLMs when they’ll help us better achieve our goals. At Khan, one of our values is “Cultivate Learning Mindsets”, so for us, it’s important that we’re working with all of our engineers to help match the right opportunity to the right individual, in order to ensure every engineer is operating at their “learning edge”.
Currently, we are focused on providing equitable solutions to historically under-resourced communities of learners and teachers, and guided by our Engineering Principles. You can read about our latest work on our Engineering Blog.

About Elicit
Elicit is building the reasoning layer for science and decision-making. We use language models to search over 125 million papers, extract data, and surface insights so that researchers, policy-makers, and industry leaders can go from questions to evidence-backed decisions in minutes.
Today, hundreds of thousands of researchers have used Elicit to speed up literature reviews, automate systematic reviews, and explore new domains. As we expand our impact beyond academic research, we are laying the groundwork for ML systems that are systematic, transparent, and unbounded when reasoning at scale.
To do this, Elicit is pioneering supervision of process, not outcomes. Instead of favoring large black-box models, we break complex questions down into human-legible steps and supervise the reasoning process itself. This approach delivers more transparent, defensible answers today and charts a safer path toward advanced AI tomorrow.
Our vision is ambitious: we’re building the default starting point for understanding and reasoning through any hard question. We invite you to help us build that future.
(See how people use Elicit today on Twitter; explore our vision in the roadmap.)
About the role
As an ML research engineer at Elicit, you will: 
Compose together tens to thousands of calls to language models to accomplish tasks that we can't accomplish with a single call.
Curate datasets for finetuning models, e.g. for training models to extract policy conclusions from papers
Set up evaluation metrics that tell us what changes to our models or training setup are improvements
Scale up semantic search from a few thousand documents to 100k+ documents
About you
To help us get there:
You need to have a strong software engineering background. We want to apply your experience building systems, designing architecture, and thinking about good abstractions. Elicit will need you to do much more than write scripts.
You must be familiar with language models (training, fine-tuning, evaluation), or have a comparable machine learning or natural language processing background (e.g. experience with information extraction, semantic search)
You'll need a startup mindset. We expect to measure our impact in part by the people whose lives we improve through reasoning and models of the future. We know you care about that too. You’ll want to test lots of ideas, get feedback, and watch yourself learning and growing every day.
To get a sense for how some of us look at applications, see this thread. (The short version: Wherever we can we prefer to directly evaluate work.)
You can review a longer list of the kinds of ML-related projects you'd be working on here.
Location and travel
We have a lovely office in Oakland, CA, but we don't all work from there all the time. It's important to us to spend time with our teammates, so we ask that all Elicians come together for a quarterly team retreat, normally in and around the SF bay area.
Am I a good fit?
Consider these questions:
How does a transformer work?
What is a tokenizer?
What is a decorator in Python?
What are generic types?
Strong applicants will find it easy to answer these questions.
Benefits
In addition to working on important problems as part of a happy, productive, and positive team, we also offer great benefits (with some variation based on work location):
Flexible work environment - work from our office in Oakland or remotely as long as you can travel to work in-person for retreats and coworking events
Fully covered health, dental, vision, and life insurance for you, generous coverage for the rest of your family
Flexible vacation policy, with a minimum recommendation of 20 days/year + company holidays
401K with a 6% employer match
A new Mac + $1,000 budget to set up your workstation or home office in your first year, then $500 every year thereafter
$1,000 quarterly AI Experimentation & Learning budget, so you can freely experiment with new AI tools to incorporate into your workflow, take courses, purchase educational resources, or attend AI-focused conferences and events
A team administrative assistant that you can delegate personal and work tasks to
Commuter benefits, a relocation bonus, and more!
You can find more reasons to work with us in this thread.
Compensation
For all roles at Elicit, we use a data-backed compensation framework to make sure our salaries are market-competitive, equitable, and simple. For this role, we're targeting starting ranges of:
Career (L3): $185-250K + equity
Senior (L4): $230-300K + equity
Expert/Staff (L5): $255-340K + significant equity
We're optimizing for a hire who can contribute at a L4/senior-level or above. We'd love to meet staff/principal level contributors as well.
We also offer above-market equity for all roles at Elicit, as well as employee-friendly equity terms.

Elicit is building a research agent that can use an unlimited amount of test-time compute while keeping its reasoning transparent and verifiable.
The residency
Transformers do a fixed amount of computation per token, and the quality of work degrades rapidly when they are applied iteratively. As research resident, you'll work with us for 3 months on developing computational procedures (operators) that can reliably improve a knowledge state over thousands of iterations.
What is a knowledge state? A knowledge state consists of structured information - for example, a scientific paper might be represented as a set of claims supported by evidence and connected through logical reasoning; this might be combined with scratchpads, evergreen “notes to self”, search trees, and other information.
What counts as improvement? Like scientists, we want LLMs to make genuine progress in understanding - separating inferences from raw evidence, finding connections between ideas, building clearer explanations, and identifying gaps in reasoning. But unlike typical ML systems that are often trained to do “whatever works”, we need improvements that are epistemically sound - each step should make the knowledge state more useful while remaining human-readable. An improvement might reorganize information to better answer a question, find an implicit assumption in an argument, or connect evidence across multiple sources.
As research resident, your work will focus on designing and testing improvement operators that maintain stability over 1000+ iterations while making genuine progress. You'll start with simple cases (e.g., shallow refactoring of scientific papers) and demonstrate reliable iteration before scaling to more complex reasoning tasks.
Developing systems that perform legible reasoning over long horizons addresses core challenges in AI transparency and scalable reasoning.
About you
Strong candidates will have experience with LLMs, good intuitions about what makes reasoning systematic and verifiable, and care about AI transparency.
The best applicants will additionally have a strong software engineering background and concrete examples of how they've applied this background to come up with novel abstractions that push the frontiers of automated reasoning.

About Elicit
Elicit is an AI research assistant that uses language models to help researchers figure out what’s true and make better decisions, starting with common research tasks like literature review.
What we're aiming for:
Elicit radically increases the amount of good reasoning in the world.
For experts, Elicit pushes the frontier forward.
For non-experts, Elicit makes good reasoning more affordable. People who don't have the tools, expertise, time, or mental energy to make well-reasoned decisions on their own can do so with Elicit.
Elicit is a scalable ML system based on human-understandable task decompositions, with supervision of process, not outcomes. This expands our collective understanding of safe AGI architectures.
Visit our Twitter to learn more about how Elicit is helping researchers and making progress on our mission.
What is an 'AI Engineer'?
AI engineering is a new category of technical work. Its emergence is linked to the increasing availability of powerful new artificial intelligence tools: notably generative machine learning systems like large language models.
The term was suggested by swyx on the Latent Space podcast and we've written about it on our blog before.
Elicit predicted the rise of powerful ML systems even before GPT-1 was trained, and has the deepest experience of building trustworthy, capable, and transparent applications using these tools.
If you're a software engineer who relishes the more difficult parts of backend code—like concurrency, fault-tolerance, and distributed systems—you could be a great AI engineer.
Why we're hiring for this role
Since launching the newest version of Elicit last fall, response has been strong. We introduced Elicit Plus, our monthly subscription plan, and added thousands of paying users in a matter of months as well as hundreds of thousands of new sign-ups. This has been energizing for our team, but we want to ship more useful functionality to our users even faster.
We believe that building great AI-powered products requires excellence across multiple parts of the tech stack: from frontend UX to infrastructure. But one of the crux areas is certainly how we prompt, invoke, respond to, and manage the suite of different ML models required to make Elicit work. This is what an AI engineer will be responsible for at Elicit.
Our tech stack
Backend: Node and Python.
Frontend: Next.js and TypeScript (we expect you to be 80+% focussed on backend work, however).
We like static type checking in Python and TypeScript
All infrastructure runs in Kubernetes across a couple of clouds
We use GitHub for code reviews and CI
Am I a good fit?
Consider the questions:
What's the difference between anyio, trio, and asyncio?
What does the await keyword do in JavaScript?
What is a Kubernetes pod, and how is it different from a container?
How would you manage state when using an LLM to power a conversation?
If you have a solid answer for these—without reference to documentation—then we should chat!
What you'll own
Backend implementation of our 'living document'
We believe that user interactions with language models should be much deeper than yet more chatbot interfaces.
We wrote about our living document approach which is one way in which users can have much richer LLM-powered product experiences.
You would work on, curate, extend, and improve the backend part of that technology. This is fascinating and challenging distributed systems work.
Building Elicit into a product researchers can’t live without
We ship useful, exciting features out to users on a weekly basis. Your focus will be on the code which exists between the BFF endpoints and the ML models we use.
You will work on a mix of known features / fixes, prototypes to validate ideas, and exploratory projects in between.
Our team is small, so we expect you to appreciate the user needs underlying everything you work on. You should be comfortable making decisions and trade-offs that help us fulfill users’ needs best.
Keeping Elicit’s bar for quality high
You’ll balance shipping features in the short term with building extensible and maintainable systems.
You will be responsible for your features in production: they need to be scalable, resilient, and easy to operate.
You’ll contribute to discussions around system design, performance evaluation, and architecture.
Projects you'll contribute to
You can view sample projects here.
What you bring to the role
Strong technical aptitude that allows you to move comfortably around our back-end tech stack, with strong computer science fundamentals.
A genuine curiosity and enthusiasm for the capabilities of language models.
A defensive, fault-first mindset.
Above-average communication skills. Elicit is a small, highly-collaborative team, so you’ll frequently be tapped to communicate complex engineering topics with stakeholders across the company.
A sense of joy in what you do. One thing we love about our team at Elicit is that everybody’s a craftsperson who cares deeply about their field.
Your first week
Start building foundational context
Get to know your team, our stack, and the product roadmap.
You’ll get to know our company documentation and other supporting resources like Supporting Process, not Outcomes.
Make your first contribution to Elicit
By the end of your first week, you’ll have completed your first Linear issue, have a PR merged into our monorepo, gained understanding of our CI/CD pipeline, and learned about our monitoring and logging tools.
Your first month
You’ll complete your first multi-issue project
As you learn the ropes, you’re able to tackle more impactful projects, with input from domain experts where you need it.
You’re actively improving the team
You’ll have gotten into the swing of contributing to regular team meetings and hack days, and you’ve demoed something you’ve worked on during a team sync.
You’ve added some documentation, how-to guides, diagrams, or other resources meant to help us and new hires in the future.
You’ve suggested an improvement to our development process.
Your first quarter
You’re flying solo
With the context you’ve gained, you’re able to implement changes independently and you’re comfortable making big, impactful decisions in the course of your work.
You’ve developed an area of expertise
Our engineering team is just a few people, so each person quickly becomes a go-to resource in some area of the tech. Within your first quarter, we expect that there’s a part of Elicit you’ll become the domain expert for that others reach out to for support when working in this area.
You actively research and improve the product
By the end of your first quarter, you’ll have gotten to know Elicit and our users well. We expect that you’ll have thought about and scoped some user-facing improvements to the product as well as identified technical improvements to implement.
Location and travel
We have a lovely office in Oakland, CA, but we don't all work from there all the time. It's important to us to spend time with our teammates, however we have a quarterly team retreat, normally in and around the SF bay area.
Compensation, benefits, and perks
In addition to working on important problems as part of a productive and positive team, we also offer great benefits (with some variation based on location):
Flexible work environment: work from our office in Oakland or remotely with time zone overlap (between GMT and GMT-8), as long as you can travel for in-person retreats and coworking events
Fully covered health, dental, vision, and life insurance for you, generous coverage for the rest of your family
Flexible vacation policy, with a minimum recommendation of 20 days/year + company holidays
401K with a 6% employer match
A new Mac + $1,000 budget to set up your workstation or home office in your first year, then $500 every year thereafter
$1,000 quarterly AI Experimentation & Learning budget, so you can freely experiment with new AI tools to incorporate into your workflow, take courses, purchase educational resources, or attend AI-focused conferences and events
A team administrative assistant who can help you with personal and work tasks
You can find more reasons to work with us in this thread!
For all roles at Elicit, we use a data-backed compensation framework to keep salaries market-competitive, equitable, and simple to understand. For this role, we target starting ranges of:
Senior (L4): $195-285k + equity
Expert (L5): $220-320k + equity
Principal (L6): >$265 + significant equity
We're optimizing for a hire who can contribute at a L4/senior-level or above.
We offer above-market equity for all roles at Elicit, as well as employee-friendly equity terms.

About Andela:
At Andela, we know brilliance is evenly distributed around the world, but opportunity is not. For over 10 years, Andela has connected its customers with top global, remote technical talent from over 135 countries with the majority residing in emerging markets like Africa and Latin America.
As one of the world’s largest talent marketplaces, Andela gives companies greater flexibility to quickly deploy qualified technologists. With talent highly skilled in advanced technologies to support Application Development, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud & DevOps, Data Engineering, and much more, customers experience 33% faster project delivery. The company’s exclusive AI-powered platform, Andela Talent Cloud, is the industry’s only unified platform managing the complete global talent lifecycle and enables customers to fill individual roles or engage fully managed teams up to 66% faster.
Andela is on the precipice of two breakout industry transformations: one in staffing/hiring and the other in software development, both accelerated by generative AI.
Join us and change the world.
Job Summary:
The AI Solution Manager drives the strategy and commercialization of assigned AI solutions, transforming custom programs into scalable, high-margin Solution Packages.
This is a strategic and commercial role combining product management, go-to-market, and partnerships, requiring strategic thinking, commercial acumen, and technical fluency.
Exceptional Leadership:
As an Andelan, you’ll serve as a role model for the rest of the company. Think about the feedback your peers typically give you – if it usually sounds like the below, we want to hear from you. 
Low ego, low drama, servant leader: You share credit, take blame. You like being wrong because it means someone else had an even better idea. 
One team mentality: You break silos across teams. You put the company and mission first above your team alone. 
Great listener, hungry for feedback: You’re always seeking to improve – our product, our business, yourself. You solicit diverse opinions and deeply listen. 
Owner, not renter: You see a problem, you fix it or find someone who will. The buck stops with you.
Player-coach: You fly high (create strategy) AND low (know the details that matter). You roll up your sleeves and get scrappy. You do this proactively collaborating with your team while actively engaging in important details. 
Business problem solver: You’re not just a functional expert; you consistently get praise for approaching your function through the lens of solving business problems. 
Key Responsibilities (by weight):
Solution Strategy & IP Development (40%): Design scalable Solution Packages (50-70%+ margin, outcome-based), define roadmaps, capture IP/build playbooks for 10X faster deployment, and define solution scope/success criteria.
Commercialization & Go-to-Market (40%): Create sales enablement (battle cards, ROI calculators, training), design pricing (T&M → outcome-based), define ICPs, support demand generation, and identify 'lighthouse customers.'
Partnerships & Ecosystem (20%): Identify and cultivate strategic technology (AWS, Databricks, LLM platforms) and SI (Accenture, Deloitte) partnerships; develop co-marketing/co-selling motions; represent Andela in thought leadership.
Success Metrics:
90 Days: Approved solution strategy, sales enablement complete, 2-3 lighthouse customers engaged.
6 Months: First Solution Package (alpha) launched, $500K-$1M pipeline, 3-5 reference case studies, 1-2 partnerships activated.
12 Months: Solution Package matured (beta/final), $2M-$5M revenue, 50-70%+ margins, solution becomes a competitive differentiator.
Required Qualifications:
Experience: 8-12 years in solutions consulting, product management, or GTM, with 5+ years in B2B enterprise software/services. Proven 0-to-1 track record (strategy → packaging → commercialization → revenue).
Skills: Strategic, Commercial (pricing design), Sales Enablement, Executive Communication, Technical Fluency (moderate depth), and AI/ML Fundamentals (preferred).
Preferred Qualifications:
Top-tier consulting or boutique firm experience.
Product management with full GTM responsibility.
Partnerships experience.

About Elicit
Elicit is an AI research assistant that uses language models to help researchers figure out what’s true and make better decisions, starting with common research tasks like literature review.
What we're aiming for:
Elicit radically increases the amount of good reasoning in the world.
For experts, Elicit pushes the frontier forward.
For non-experts, Elicit makes good reasoning more affordable. People who don't have the tools, expertise, time, or mental energy to make well-reasoned decisions on their own can do so with Elicit.
Elicit is a scalable ML system based on human-understandable task decompositions, with supervision of process, not outcomes. This expands our collective understanding of safe AGI architectures.
Visit our Twitter to learn more about how Elicit is helping researchers and making progress on our mission.
Why we're hiring for this role
We have product-market fit, with several hundreds of thousands of monthly active users, a few million in ARR since launching our paid subscription last year, and significant inbound enterprise interest every day. This has been energizing for our team, but we want to take it to the next level. We dream of helping significantly more people with more types of thinking. That’s where you come in. Take the foundations we’ve established and build something with an even bigger impact. There is no other role like this. You’ll work in a space where every day brings leaps forward in the technological capabilities of the models. You’ll build entirely new, language-model-first paradigms. You’ll prioritize true, lasting impact and not short-term profits.
Your day-to-day
Lead machine-learning based projects from concept through launch. You’ll lead the team’s approach toward new functionality and improvements in Elicit by setting the product vision, generating and validating solutions, and evolving experiences to have the greatest possible impact. You’ll drive projects end-to-end, from prototype to implementation to later iteration.
Solving Elicit’s toughest product challenges. You will rarely (if ever) start with a defined product project at Elicit. You’ll get to work across functions to push the progression of the product and shape how Elicit works. We need you to think through intuitive, focused product solutions to help our users get the most accurate and relevant information out of Elicit. 
Embodying the voice of our users. You’ll work with the team to develop a deep understanding of users’ behaviors, drive user research, and leverage that information into hypotheses and design experiments that guide us toward the best user outcomes.
Ensuring the success of new Elicit features. You’ll work closely with the Head of Product, our CEO, and our team of engineers, ML engineers and designers to define the product strategy & roadmap, define success metrics for new features and improvements to Elicit, ensure high-quality implementation, and ship at a high velocity.
The skills & experiences we’re looking for
ML foundational competency: you have 2+ years working in ML and/or with LLMs. You are comfortable shipping some simple PRs and doing basic eval work yourself. 
Execution excellence. You take full ownership and get things done. You have a proven track record (6+ years) of launching new products that drive long-term customer love and business impact. You are comfortable across the full stack of product management - defining success, writing specs, talking to users, running analytics, prioritizing feature work, managing releases, etc. You have led a multi-functional team of engineers and designers and managed products across their full life cycle. 
Early-stage mindset. You thrive in the high-velocity, high ambiguity, 'zero to one” early stages of product building. You're willing to do the unglamorous work early on, then systematize what works. You have hands-on experience at early-stage, fast-growing startups, working directly with design and engineering teams. 
Customer obsession. You're genuinely excited about working with researchers and have an instinct for uncovering their deepest needs and pain points. 
First-principles thinking. There are no experts on AI research assistants yet - you should be excited about pioneering this space: deeply understanding AI’s potential while uncovering what is holding research back. 
Humility & truth-seeking. Our mission is to scale up high-quality reasoning. We care a lot about rigorous thinking and communication, without ego and always seeking the truth. We want someone who is very iterative and highly-receptive to feedback; someone that knows their strengths and how to leverage them, and also their development areas. 
Experiences that are not required but are extra helpful:
Building products for researchers or biomedical companies
Experience building tools-for-thought, solving complex workflows, or scaling Enterprise/SaaS apps 
We are also open to more senior PM candidates (ie Principal, Group PM). We encourage everyone who is interested to apply, even if you're not sure you match the full description here. 
Compensation & Benefits
In addition to working on important problems as part of a happy, productive, and positive team, we also offer great benefits (with some variation based on work location):
Flexible work environment. You can work from our office in Oakland or remotely with time zone overlap with PST.
Quarterly in-person retreats and coworking events.
Fully covered health, dental, vision, and life insurance for you + generous coverage for the rest of your family.
Flexible vacation policy with a minimum recommendation of 20 days per year.
401(k) with a 6% employer match.
A new Mac + $1,000 budget to set up your workstation or home office in your first year, then $500 every year thereafter.
$1,000 quarterly AI Experimentation & Learning budget, so you can freely experiment with new AI tools to incorporate into your workflow, take courses, purchase educational resources, or attend AI-focused conferences and events.
A team administrative assistant who can help you with personal and work tasks.
You can find more reasons to work with us in this thread.
For all roles at Elicit, we use a data-backed compensation framework to keep salaries market-competitive, equitable, and simple to understand. For this role, we target starting ranges of:
Senior (L4): $190-250k + equity
Expert (L5): $220-290k + equity
We're optimizing for a hire who can contribute at an L4/senior-level or above. We'd love to meet staff/principal level contributors as well.
We offer above-market equity for all roles at Elicit, as well as employee-friendly equity terms.

About The Role
At its core, the AI Strategy Consultant role centers around driving marketing strategy and transformation in enterprise organizations.
Today, most marketing communications are planned weeks in advance on a calendar based on dates and internal priorities. Each email, push, campaign takes 3-5 people and dozens of steps to create. Our customers come to us looking to transform the way they do marketing: using AI agents to rapidly learn about consumer preferences and deliver highly effective marketing and product experiences to each customer 1:1. Strategy Consultants are responsible for turning that vision into reality.
As a Strategy Consultant, you’ll work with as a part of a driven and creative team of ML + product engineers, product designers, and other Strategy Consultants to deploy new use cases with the largest customer-facing brands in the world. Your mission is to uncover the most impactful use cases for our customers, understand the insights that are derived from the decision engine, and recommend to our customers new campaigns or adjustments they can to achieve greater outcomes.
You’ll immerse yourself in our customer’s marketing organization. You’ll partner with customer teams and explore the data, and plunge into the product landscape to help us scale. In this role, the problems you’ll seek will require a curious and analytical approach, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree to use insight to ultimately empower our customers to improve decisions.
No two days are the same, but you can expect to:
Own all phases of AI Decisioning use case delivery working alongside Hightouch engineers, customer executives, marketers, and IT stakeholders
Run design sessions with customers to decide on and document use case requirements and improvements
Champion delivery & project management excellence through development of process playbooks and best practices
Proactively identify, escalate and mitigate potential project risks
Build relationships with key stakeholders at Hightouch customers
Participate in determining the AI Decisioning product strategy
What We're Looking For
Ability to travel 10 - 25% required
Experience working with Martech tools/CEMs/CDPs/etc.
Strong discovery and interpersonal skills
Intellectual curiosity, high ambition, and humility
Clear communicator: you are able to express yourself clearly and persuasively, both in writing and speech
Experience managing and executing technical projects with a customer-first attitude and a strong sense of empathy
Bonus If You Have
Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab, SQL)
We are looking for talented, intellectually curious, and motivated individuals who are interested in tackling the problems above. We focus on impact and potential for growth more than years of experience. The salary range for this position is $170,000-$200,000 (80/20 split variable) USD per year.

The Reality:
Being an AI PM isn't sexy. You'll spend hours in spreadsheets evaluating AI outputs, reviewing hundreds of user conversations weekly, and debugging why your research agent just hallucinated a company's tech stack. But when you get it right—when you see adoption explode because sales teams actually trust your AI—it's the most rewarding work in product.
Apollo's AI platform powers 54,000+ weekly active users and 130M+ prospecting actions. We've grown AI adoption 5x in the last year by obsessing over something most teams overlook: does our AI actually work when a sales rep needs it to?
The Vision:
We're building the AI-native operating system for go-to-market teams, anchored by our AI Assistant. Just say 'Find me financial firms in New York that grew headcount 30% last month,' and the Assistant instantly applies the right filters. Add 'Notify me via Slack and create a call task,' and it sets up complete workflows in seconds. The Assistant helps reps discover qualified leads, conduct research, and automate outbound—all through natural conversation.
Beyond the Assistant, our AI platform powers natural language search, AI-driven research agents, personalized messaging, and ML-powered lead scoring—all designed to help sales teams find the right prospects, deliver messages that resonate, and book more meetings.
This role owns AI research, messaging, and context—spanning both the user experience and the underlying infrastructure. You'll define how we surface insights from the web, craft messages that actually convert, and gather the business context that makes AI outputs relevant. From prompt architecture to product UX, you'll shape how sales teams interact with AI across their entire workflow.
What You'll Do:
Own AI Product Strategy and Vision-
Develop and execute a strategic roadmap for AI research, messaging, and context capabilities. Your vision will guide how sales teams leverage AI to understand prospects deeply and engage them with relevance.
Elevate AI Research-
Enhance Apollo's AI research agents to surface actionable insights from the web—pain points, buying signals, competitive intelligence, and account context. You'll focus on delivering research that helps reps lead with value, not generic personalization.
Build Context Systems-
Define how AI understands each user's business—their personas, value propositions, target pain points, and competitive positioning. You'll build the context infrastructure that transforms generic AI outputs into relevant, business-aware recommendations.
Transform AI Messaging-
Own AI-powered messaging tools that create personalized, context-aware emails at scale. You'll improve response rates by ensuring AI matches each rep's authentic voice while incorporating research insights that resonate with prospects.
Own AI Quality & Evaluation-
Build and scale evaluation infrastructure across accuracy, relevance, clarity, and tone. Nothing ships without hitting quality thresholds. You'll spend time in production data—reviewing real user conversations, identifying failure patterns, and turning them into systematic improvements.
Collaborate Across Teams-
Partner with engineering, design, prompt writers, and sales to deliver cohesive AI experiences. You'll work closely with domain experts to infuse GTM best practices into every feature and ensure AI outputs match what top performers would actually send.
What We're Looking For:
Proven AI Product Experience-
5+ years in product management, with 2+ years experience launching AI/ML new products and scaling existing products. 
Track record of shipping AI features that drove measurable business outcomes—not just demos that looked good in meetings.
Experience with LLM-powered applications, prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, and model selection tradeoffs.
Founder background is a plus.
Technical Depth Without Engineering Hat-
Comfortable working in Python/SQL to analyze data, prototype prompts, and evaluate outputs.
Understanding of LLM architectures, RAG pipelines, agent frameworks, and inference optimization.
Ability to have substantive technical conversations with ML engineers while keeping focus on user outcomes.
Obsession with Quality Over Speed-
You believe 'ship fast' means nothing if users don't trust the output.
You've built evaluation infrastructure—not just shipped on vibes.
You understand that AI adoption follows a trust curve, not a capability curve.
GTM or Sales Tech Experience (Strongly Preferred)-
Familiarity with sales workflows, prospecting tools, or CRM systems.
Understanding of why sales teams are skeptical of AI tools and what it takes to earn their trust.
Experience building for SMB users who want results, not complexity.
What Will Make You Successful at Apollo:
You're comfortable with ambiguity. AI product work means constant iteration—what worked yesterday might not work tomorrow.
You lead with data. Every product decision ties back to user behavior, evaluation scores, or business metrics.
You're a hands-on builder. You prototype, you evaluate, you debug—you don't just write PRDs and wait.
You believe domain expertise beats technical sophistication. The best prompts come from sales experts, not engineers.
You move fast without breaking trust. Speed matters, but not at the cost of shipping AI that makes users look foolish.
The listed Pay Range reflects base salary range, except for sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings ('OTE') range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commission/sales bonus targets and annual base salary for the role.

Hi, I'm Mark, and I lead Jane's AI Transformation team. I've been at Jane for 6 years, and our team's mission is to build the platform that turns every person at Jane into an AI-powered builder.
At Jane, we believe AI should be human-in-control, privacy-conscious, and mission-aligned. We're not chasing hype - we're building infrastructure that helps the helpers do their best work. Our mantra: automate the ordinary so we can focus on the meaningful.
As a Staff AI Tooling Engineer, you won't just build internal tools - you'll help architect Jane's AI platform from the ground up. That means designing the knowledge systems that let agents discover and use context securely, building the orchestration layer that connects our core systems, and enabling teams across Jane to create their own AI-powered workflows. You'll work closely with Support, Finance, Recruiting, Operations, and Product to turn focused pilots into scalable, trustworthy solutions.
This role sits at the intersection of platform engineering, applied AI, and organizational transformation. You'll help define how 700+ people work with AI every day, by building both the platform and the tools to help them succeed.
What Impact We're Looking for You to Make
Build Jane's AI platform infrastructure: Design and implement the foundational systems - knowledge graphs, context management, secure integrations - that enable teams to build and deploy AI agents confidently.
Enable transformation, not just optimization: Partner with teams to identify opportunities where AI can fundamentally change how work gets done, not just make existing processes 10% faster. We're aiming for 10x improvements through reimagining workflows entirely.
Connect and orchestrate: Integrate core systems (HubSpot, Helpscout/Intercom, HRIS, Looker/Snowflake, GitHub, Jira, Slack) into a coherent platform where context flows securely to the agents and people who need it.
Shape our approach: We're still making foundational platform decisions. You'll have real input into the tools, patterns, and standards that define how AI works at Jane for years to come.
Build a culture of builders: Create documentation, patterns, and examples that help non-engineers across Jane become confident AI builders. Your success is measured partly by how many people you enable.
What Experience We're Looking For
10+ years of software engineering experience, with meaningful exposure to AI/ML systems, LLM integration, or agent-based architectures.
You provide technical leadership and are able to remove friction and amplify the impact of the people around you.
Strong backend engineering skills (Python, TypeScript, or Go). You write clean, maintainable systems that others can build on.
Experience with context engineering patterns: RAG architectures, knowledge graphs, embedding systems, or similar approaches to giving AI systems the right information at the right time.
Familiarity with agent frameworks, orchestration platforms, or workflow automation systems. You understand how to build AI that takes action, not just generates text.
A strong security and compliance instinct. Ideally you've built systems in regulated environments (healthcare, finance, or similar). You think about data flows, access controls, and audit trails as core design concerns.
Comfort with ambiguity and emerging technology. The AI landscape shifts fast; you stay curious, experiment thoughtfully, and adapt.
Clear communication skills. You can explain AI capabilities and limitations to non-technical teammates and build trust through transparency.
More About Jane
Jane is a founder-led, high-growth SaaS company born in North Vancouver, British Columbia. We're a team of more than 700 people working remotely across Canada, the US, and the UK, united by our mission to help the helpers.
We build the products and tools that thousands of clinics rely on every day to run their businesses, care for their patients, and grow their communities. That level of impact means every person at Jane plays an important role in how we show up for our customers.
Jane is growing fast, and that growth brings challenges that call for adaptability, resilience, and humility. We're proud of what we've built and quick to admit what we don't know yet. We listen, learn, and adjust.
Our goal isn't just delivery—it's delight. We move quickly, communicate openly, and solve real problems together. If you're energized by building something new, motivated by impact, and ready to help define how AI works at a company that genuinely cares, you'll thrive here.
Compensation & Benefits
At Jane, we’re committed to paying fairly, clearly, and above all, paying for growth. This role has an annual salary range of $158,400 to $247,500. While that is a large range, it is intentional. It reflects the full growth journey someone might take in the role, from developing skills early on to becoming highly proficient and ultimately achieving excellence.
Most new hires join at the accomplished stage, which for this role represents an annual salary of $188,100. A starting salary below this typically indicates a candidate with strong potential who is still developing key skills. Salaries above this usually apply to existing team members who have made a significant impact and bring deep Jane-specific knowledge.
We believe in paying for growth. You’ll have regular career development conversations with your manager and your compensation will grow as you gain experience and contribute meaningfully to our mission.
Paying clearly is one of our compensation fundamentals. Watch this short video to learn how our salary bands are set. You’re also encouraged to ask questions about compensation at any point during the interview process.
We also offer a comprehensive benefits package, You can learn more about it here!

Figma is all-in on AI — not just as a feature, but as a foundational shift in how we build, scale, and serve our users. As our CEO and executive team have shared, AI is central to Figma’s long-term product strategy, and we're investing deeply across the stack: from model quality and infrastructure reliability to data pipelines and evaluation workflows.
We’re hiring a seasoned Technical Program Manager (TPM) to help lead the platform side of that work — building scalable systems to support annotation, capacity planning, and model delivery. This is a technical, execution-heavy role for a seasoned TPM who would be excited to solve AI reliability, scale, and data quality in equal parts.
You’ll partner closely with engineering, infra, design, AI research, and product teams to manage cross-org delivery of our most important AI Services — and help ensure our infra and evaluation loops scale to meet real product demand.

What you'll do at Figma:
Own and drive programs supporting Figma’s AI platform — including annotation velocity, evaluation pipelines, and cost/capacity readiness
Partner with Infra and Finance to plan model scaling across providers: track token usage, forecast traffic, manage regional limits, optimize caching strategies, and reduce latency
Lead our internal AI Annotation Program: manage vendors and design annotators. Define task priorities, improve quality standards and increase annotator throughput
Support internal AIOps initiatives — model go/no-go decision making, monitor model behavior, prevent regressions, and ensure readiness across quality gates
Drive cross-functional execution of key AI-powered product features — coordinate scope, risks, comms, and launch checklists
Partner with Data Science to maintain and improve internal visibility: annotation metrics, token quotas, reliability dashboards, and evaluation timelines

4+ years of technical program management experience (or equivalent) in AI platform, AI research, and AI infrastructure
Understand how AI gets built and scaled: model evaluation loops, annotation pipelines, quota limits, and data versioning
Have hands-on experience running AI cost/capacity reviews, forecast planning, and vendor oversight. Deep understanding of model cost mechanics, including token burn, cache hit rates, latency, and quota limits
Comfort operating in high-ambiguity, high-velocity environments with exec visibility
Strong writing and communication skills — you bring structure, clarity, and momentum to complex technical programs
Bring a systems-thinking mindset to the AI delivery pipeline, and know where to tighten loops or increase speed
While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you also have:
Experience with AI vendor contracts, third-party API quotas, or multi-cloud capacity planning
Background in AIOps / model quality pipelines — even better if you've built or scaled them
Scaled contractor or external vendor teams delivering core data operations
Strong bias to action, self-motivation and curiosity, with desire to bring people together and deliver high quality results in the constantly evolving growth and excitement of a start-up culture
Familiarity with a modern scaled web stack (AWS, Sinatra, React)
